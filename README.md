The ipython file has all the steps and desciptions. Before you run this ipython notebook you need to download all the content in this google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1xSNHbVq8XRSDRQVndpZkNkZlE?usp=sharing (some files are too large, so I did't put here). And then change the folder parameter to the full path of your downloaded folder.
